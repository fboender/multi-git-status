mgitstatus
==========

Show uncommitted, untracked and unpushed changes in multiple Git
repositories.  Scan for .git dirs up to **DEPTH** directories deep.
The default is 2.  If **DEPTH** is 0, the scan is infinitely deep.

mgitstatus shows:

* **Uncommitted changes** if there are unstaged or uncommitted changes on the
  checked out branch.
* **Untracked files** if there are untracked files which are not ignored.
* **Needs push (BRANCH)** if the branch is tracking a (remote) branch which is
  behind.
* **Needs upstream (BRANCH)** if a branch does not have a local or remote
  upstream branch configured. Changes in the branch may otherwise never be
  pushed or merged.
* **Needs pull (BRANCH)** if the branch is tracking a (remote) branch which is
  ahead. This requires that the local git repo already knows about the remote
  changes (i.e. you've done a `fetch`), or that you specify the `-f` option.
  mgitstatus does NOT contact the remote by default.
* **X stashes** if there are stashes.

Since there are a lot of different states a git repository can be in,
mgitstatus makes no guarantees that *all* states are taken into account.

mgitstatus can also list dirs that are not a repo, if given the `-w`
switch. To ignore certain repos, set the `mgitstatus.ignore` git config flag
for that repo to `true`. (See "usage" below for an example).


# Usage

    Usage: mgitstatus [--version] [-w] [-e] [-f] [--throttle SEC] [-c] [-d/--depth=2] [--flatten] [--no-X] [DIR [DIR]...]

    mgitstatus shows uncommitted, untracked and unpushed changes in multiple Git
    repositories. By default, mgitstatus scans two directories deep. This can be
    changed with the -d (--depth) option.  If DEPTH is 0, the scan is infinitely
    deep.

      --version        Show version
      -w               Warn about dirs that are not Git repositories
      -e               Exclude repos that are 'ok'
      -f               Do a 'git fetch' on each repo (slow for many repos)
      --throttle SEC   Wait SEC seconds between each 'git fetch' (-f option)
      -c               Force color output (preserve colors when using pipes)
      -d, --depth=2    Scan this many directories deep
      --flatten        Show only one status per line

    You can limit output with the following options:

      --no-push
      --no-pull
      --no-upstream
      --no-uncommitted
      --no-untracked
      --no-stashes
      --no-ok          (same as -e)

The following example scans all directories under the current dir, with a
depth of 2. That means the current dir and all directories directly under it.

    ~/Projects/fboender $ mgitstatus
    ./mgitstatus: ok
    ./mdpreview: ok
    ./snippets: ok
    ./boxes: ok
    ./ansible-cmdb: Uncommitted changes Untracked files
    ./scriptform: Uncommitted changes
